SLUGGER Outfield Positioning Optimizer
Overview

The SLUGGER Outfield Positioning Optimizer is a web-based analytics tool designed to compute and visualize optimal defensive outfield positioning in baseball using historical batted-ball data. Developed in collaboration with the SLUGGER platform team, the project translates Trackman-derived spray data into actionable positioning recommendations for left field, center field, and right field.

While offensive analytics have become widely accessible, defensive positioning tools remain largely proprietary. This project aims to bridge that gap by formalizing outfield defense as a quantifiable optimization problem and deploying it as an interactive, research-oriented web application.
